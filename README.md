# viz-khalifa
For our Data Visualization final project, myself, @jacqui-ngo, and @sridhar decided to use visualizations 
and a predictive model to examine our own music tastes and create a playlist all of us would enjoy.

We got the data through the Spotify API - shoutout Spotify for allowing this kind of access. 

This repository contains the Python code used to get the data, develop the model, and do some visualizations. 
It also includes the Tableau workbooks we created for some visualizations. 

Feel free to download everything and create a playlist for you and your friends!

See the video below that we created and submitted as our final work product:
