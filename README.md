For our Data Visualization final project, myself, @jacqui-ngo, and @sridhar decided to use visualizations 
and a predictive model to examine our own music tastes and create a playlist all of us would enjoy.

We got the data through the Spotify API - shoutout Spotify for allowing this kind of access.
